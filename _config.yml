about_content: | 
  저는 임베디드 개발자가 되고싶은 오석준입니다.
  학부시절 여러 프로젝트를 수행하며 개발자의 꿈을 키울 수 있었습니다.
  특히 임베디드 시스템 수업을 통하여 다양한 센서와 모듈을 활용하여 원하는 서비스를 구현하는 과정은 임베디드의 개발자로 진로를 결정하게 해준 경험입니다.
  대학을 졸업한 후  실무에서 많이 사용되는 다양한 임베디드 보드에 대한 개발 경험을 쌓기 위해 대한상공회의소 서울기술교육센터에서 자율형 IoT 기반 Reality AI 융합 전문가 과정을 수료하고 있습니다. 
  교육과정을 통하 ARM Cortex-M3/M4, Udoo, Raspberry Pi,Jetson nano 등 다양한 임베디드 보드에 대한 경험을 쌓을 수 있었으며, 디바이스 드라이버 개발 및 펌웨어 개발 등도 경험해 보았습니다. 
  
  저의 모토는 나의 위치에서 내가 해야 할 일을 성실하고 꾸준하게 책임감 있게 행동하는 것입니다.
  이러한 경험들을 바탕으로, 회사에서 성장하고 발전하며 기여하고싶습니다. 
 
 

  I am most skilled in: <mark>C++</mark> and <mark>C</mark>

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
